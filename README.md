# Genshin Impact Inventory

Live site: <https://genshin-impact-inventory.herokuapp.com/>


## Overview

During our back-end unit at General Assembly (Jan - Apr 2021), we were assigned a project to make a RESTful app that was full CRUD. I decided to make something centered around the game I was playing the most, Genshin Impact. At the time, farming artifacts was my #1 priority, so I decided to start there.


## About the App

The primary goal of this app is to track all of the most important items you have in your inventory. Version 1 focuses on artifacts. Artifacts are essential for making sure your character is strong and ready for whatever Teyvat has in store for them. We help you document and keep track of your artifacts so you can plan accordingly.

* Delete an artifact if you no longer want to document it
* Return to the website at a future date to view your artifacts again.
